# Omarchy VPN

A VPN widget for the Omarchy Quattro bar. One icon, one panel, all your tunnels.

I run a homelab behind a WireGuard tunnel and PIA for everything else, and I got
tired of squinting at two separate indicators that both lied to me. So: one icon.
Click it, see every tunnel, flip whichever one you need.

Three providers ship with it: **PIA**, **WireGuard**, and a **generic CLI**
provider that drives anything with a command line. Mullvad, Proton, NordVPN,
IVPN, Mozilla VPN, Windscribe, AirVPN, FortiVPN, or any NetworkManager profile,
all from config, no code. There's a [cookbook](#cookbook) with ready-made
entries.

And you can run several at once. A homelab tunnel and a commercial VPN sit side
by side in the same panel, each with its own state, traffic and switch.

## This fork

This is a fork of [paulie420's original](https://github.com/Paulie420/omarchy-vpn),
forked by [atomicangel](https://github.com/atomicangel), with one purpose:
making WireGuard tunnels that **NetworkManager manages** first-class citizens.
The stock WireGuard provider drives `systemctl start/stop wg-quick@<iface>` —
the right lever when wg-quick owns the tunnel, the wrong one when
NetworkManager does. On an NM-managed box the unit never exists, so a
perfectly healthy tunnel shows as "Interface missing" and the switch does
nothing.

Three changes, everything else upstream's:

* **`connectionName`** — a new field on `wireguard` entries. When set, state
  is read from `nmcli con show --active` and connect/disconnect run
  `nmcli con up/down id '<connectionName>'` instead of touching the
  `wg-quick@` unit. Liveness is still judged by `rx_bytes`, so the "green
  while the peer is dead" problem this widget exists to fix stays fixed.
* **`omarchy-vpn-nm-sync.sh`** — a helper in the repository root that rebuilds
  the `wireguard` list in `shell.json` from the WireGuard profiles
  NetworkManager knows about, merging with what you already have. See
  [Keeping the list in sync](#keeping-the-list-in-sync).
* **Renamed** — the plugin ID is now `atomicangel.vpn` instead of
  `paulie420.vpn`, so the widget carries this fork's identity. Original
  authorship is kept: `author` in the manifest and the credits below still
  say paulie420.

> **Disclaimer: AI-assisted modification.** The changes in this fork — the
> `connectionName` support, the sync helper, the rename, and this README
> section — were
> implemented with an AI coding assistant, then reviewed and tested by the
> fork's maintainer on a live system. The upstream code, and the parts of the
> README left untouched, remain paulie420's work.

## Why not just cram it into the wifi menu

Because a VPN isn't a network connection, it's a policy sitting on top of one.
Omarchy already agrees with me here, the built-in Tailscale widget is its own
thing too.

## The thing that actually matters

Here's the bug that made me write this.

`wg-quick` is a `Type=oneshot` systemd unit. It flips to "active" the second the
interface exists and the routes get added. It never talks to the peer. Not once.

So if your VPN server is powered off, `systemctl is-active wg-quick@whatever`
says **active**. Forever. Cheerfully. While absolutely nothing goes through the
tunnel. My old status script believed it, and I burned an entire afternoon at a
beach house debugging my laptop, my wifi, and eventually my own sanity, before
discovering the VM running PiVPN had simply been powered off the whole time.

My bar was green for all of it.

This widget reads `rx_bytes` off the interface instead. Zero bytes in means no
handshake ever happened, so the icon goes red. Bytes flowing means you're
actually connected. Groundbreaking, I know.

PIA gets the same treatment for a different reason. When your PIA token expires
the daemon takes a 401, retries a few servers, gives up, and parks at
"Disconnected". Then it stops logging 401s. Check five minutes later and there's
no evidence anything is wrong, and "Disconnected" looks exactly like "you turned
it off". This widget latches it. Once PIA rejects your login it keeps yelling
**LOGGED OUT** until a connection actually succeeds.

## Which VPN am I on

Every VPN gets its own colour, so the bar answers that without you clicking
anything. One tunnel up paints the icon in that tunnel's colour. Two tunnels up
splits the glyph down the middle, one colour each. Three splits it into thirds.
A tunnel that's switched off takes up no space, so the everyday one-VPN case is
just a normal, solid-coloured icon.

Open the panel and each VPN has a matching dot next to its name. That's the
legend — it's how you learn which colour is which without memorising anything.

Colours are assigned automatically and you can override any of them with
`"color"`, either a hex value or one of your theme's role names (`accent`,
`urgent`, `foreground`, `muted`):

```jsonc
"pia": { "enabled": true, "label": "PIA", "color": "#6fcf82" },
"wireguard": [{ "label": "Homelab", "interface": "wg0", "color": "#5fa8e8" }]
```

State still wins over identity, because knowing a tunnel is *broken* matters
more than knowing which one it is:

| Colour | What it means |
|---|---|
| the VPN's own colour | connected, bytes moving |
| yellow | was fine, gone quiet (nothing in for 4 min) |
| red | up but no handshake, or PIA is logged out |
| dim | nothing is on |

So with two tunnels up and one of them dead, you get half your colour and half
red, and you know which half to go and shout at. A broken tunnel can never hide
behind a working one.

The generated palette skips red and yellow on purpose. A VPN whose identity
colour was red would be indistinguishable from a VPN that's failing, which is
the exact confusion this whole plugin exists to stop. If you override `color`
with something red, that's on you.

## What you need

* Omarchy Quattro (4.x) with `omarchy-shell`
* A Nerd Font for the icon (Omarchy ships one)
* For WireGuard: `wireguard-tools`, plus permission to start and stop the unit.
  Either add a polkit rule for `wg-quick@<iface>.service`, or point
  `connectCommand` / `disconnectCommand` at your own scripts.
* For PIA: the official client (`/opt/piavpn/bin/piactl`). Not installed? The
  PIA section just doesn't show up.

Nothing else. It doesn't install anything, and it never writes to your config.

## Install

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/atomicangel/omarchy-vpn.git --enable
omarchy bar move atomicangel.vpn --section right
```

## Uninstall

```bash
omarchy plugin remove atomicangel.vpn
```

That deletes the folder. If you added an `atomicangel.vpn` block to your
`shell.json`, delete that too. The plugin won't touch your config, which also
means it can't clean up after itself.

## Config

Everything lives in this widget's entry in `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`, and
all of it is optional.

```jsonc
{
  "id": "atomicangel.vpn",
  "refreshIntervalSec": 5,

  "pia": { "enabled": true, "label": "PIA" },

  // one object, or a list of them
  "wireguard": [{
    "enabled": true,
    "label": "Homelab",
    "interface": "wg0",

    // This fork: the NetworkManager connection name (as printed by
    // `nmcli connection show`), for tunnels NM manages. When set, state
    // comes from `nmcli con show --active` and connect/disconnect run
    // `nmcli con up/down id '<connectionName>'` instead of
    // `systemctl start/stop wg-quick@<interface>`. Leave it empty for the
    // stock wg-quick behaviour.
    "connectionName": "",

    // Optional. Hex, or a theme role name (accent / urgent / foreground /
    // muted). Leave it out and you get an automatic colour. See "Which VPN
    // am I on".
    "color": "",

    // Leave these empty and it runs systemctl start/stop wg-quick@<interface>.
    // Set them if your VPN has its own CLI, or if connecting needs to do more
    // than raise the interface. Mine drops PIA first and puts it back after.
    "connectCommand": "",
    "disconnectCommand": "",

    // Optional. Something living behind the tunnel. The panel tells you whether
    // it's reachable while you're connected. Mine points at the NAS.
    "reachabilityHost": ""
  }]
}
```

Heads up: `omarchy plugin disable` followed by `enable` resets this entry to a
bare `{"id": "atomicangel.vpn"}`. Not my doing, but it will eat your settings, so
keep a copy somewhere.

## Adding your VPN

### Most of them need zero code

There are two ways in, and neither involves writing QML.

**If it's WireGuard underneath** (Mullvad, NordLynx, Proton, plain `wg-quick`),
use the `wireguard` list. Point it at the interface, hand it the vendor's CLI:

```jsonc
"wireguard": [
  { "label": "Homelab", "interface": "wg0", "reachabilityHost": "192.168.1.10" },
  { "label": "Mullvad", "interface": "wg0-mullvad",
    "connectCommand": "mullvad connect", "disconnectCommand": "mullvad disconnect" }
]
```

Tunnels that **NetworkManager manages** get the same treatment with one extra
field: set `connectionName` to the profile name and the provider drives
`nmcli con up/down` for you — no commands needed at all.

**If it has any CLI at all**, use the `custom` list. This drives anything:

```jsonc
"custom": [
  { "label": "Proton",
    "statusCommand": "protonvpn status",
    "connectedWhen": "Connected",
    "connectCommand": "protonvpn connect -f",
    "disconnectCommand": "protonvpn disconnect",
    "interface": "proton0" }
]
```

`interface` is optional but set it if you can. It's what gives you live traffic
counters, and it's what catches your VPN's CLI claiming "connected" while the
tunnel is actually carrying nothing.

### Cookbook

Drop these into `custom` and adjust. **Check the commands and interface names on
your own box first** — I've only personally run the PIA and WireGuard ones, the
rest came from reading the source of the single-vendor plugins on the
marketplace, and vendors rename things.

```jsonc
// Mullvad
{ "label": "Mullvad", "statusCommand": "mullvad status",
  "connectedWhen": "Connected",
  "connectCommand": "mullvad connect", "disconnectCommand": "mullvad disconnect",
  "regionListCommand": "mullvad relay list | awk '/^[a-z]{2}/ {print $1}'",
  "regionSetCommand": "mullvad relay set location {}",
  "interface": "wg0-mullvad" }

// Proton VPN
{ "label": "Proton", "statusCommand": "protonvpn status",
  "connectedWhen": "Connected",
  "connectCommand": "protonvpn connect -f", "disconnectCommand": "protonvpn disconnect",
  "regionListCommand": "protonvpn countries list",
  "regionSetCommand": "protonvpn connect --country {}",
  "interface": "proton0" }

// IVPN
{ "label": "IVPN", "statusCommand": "ivpn status",
  "connectedWhen": "Connected",
  "connectCommand": "ivpn connect -last", "disconnectCommand": "ivpn disconnect" }

// Mozilla VPN
{ "label": "Mozilla", "statusCommand": "mozillavpn status",
  "connectedWhen": "active",
  "connectCommand": "mozillavpn activate", "disconnectCommand": "mozillavpn deactivate" }

// NordVPN (NordLynx is WireGuard, so the interface gives you real liveness)
{ "label": "NordVPN", "statusCommand": "nordvpn status",
  "connectedWhen": "Connected",
  "connectCommand": "nordvpn connect", "disconnectCommand": "nordvpn disconnect",
  "regionListCommand": "nordvpn countries", "regionSetCommand": "nordvpn connect {}",
  "interface": "nordlynx" }

// Windscribe
{ "label": "Windscribe", "statusCommand": "windscribe-cli status",
  "connectedWhen": "Connected",
  "connectCommand": "windscribe-cli connect", "disconnectCommand": "windscribe-cli disconnect" }

// AirVPN (NetworkManager profile)
{ "label": "AirVPN", "statusCommand": "nmcli -t -f NAME,DEVICE con show --active",
  "connectedWhen": "AirVPN",
  "connectCommand": "nmcli con up id 'AirVPN'", "disconnectCommand": "nmcli con down id 'AirVPN'" }

// FortiVPN (SSL-VPN, usually needs sudo + 2FA, so run it in a terminal)
{ "label": "FortiVPN", "statusCommand": "pgrep -a openfortivpn",
  "connectedWhen": "openfortivpn",
  "connectCommand": "omarchy-launch-tui sudo openfortivpn",
  "disconnectCommand": "sudo pkill openfortivpn", "interface": "ppp0" }

// Anything NetworkManager knows about, by profile name
{ "label": "Work VPN", "statusCommand": "nmcli -t -f NAME con show --active",
  "connectedWhen": "work-vpn",
  "connectCommand": "nmcli con up id work-vpn", "disconnectCommand": "nmcli con down id work-vpn" }
```

### Picking a server

Set `regionListCommand` (prints one option per line) and `regionSetCommand`
(with `{}` where the choice goes) and a **Change server…** row appears in the
panel. It hands the list to `omarchy-menu-select`, so you get Quattro's own
themed picker instead of something I bolted on.

PIA gets this for free, no config needed — it reads all 190 regions from
`piactl get regions`.

### Keeping the list in sync

The `wireguard` list is static: it is read when the shell loads, and the
widget never re-scans NetworkManager on its own. So when you add or remove an
NM WireGuard profile, update the list with the helper from this repo
(`omarchy-vpn-nm-sync.sh`, in the repository root):

```bash
omarchy-vpn-nm-sync.sh --dry-run   # print what would change, touch nothing
omarchy-vpn-nm-sync.sh             # rewrite the list, restart the shell
```

It rebuilds the list from `nmcli -t -f NAME,TYPE connection show` and merges
with what you have: entries whose `connectionName` still exists are kept
verbatim (your `color`, `reachabilityHost` and custom commands survive),
entries for profiles that are gone are dropped, entries without a
`connectionName` (plain wg-quick or fully custom) are left alone, and new
profiles get a default entry. It only restarts the shell when the file
actually changed, so it is safe to run on a timer.

### When you actually have to write code

Only if your VPN isn't WireGuard-based, or it knows things the generic provider
can't see. That's why PIA has its own file. It reports a region, a protocol, and
that expired-login state that otherwise looks identical to "switched off".

A provider is one QML file with this shape:

```
Properties  enabled  label  connected  busy  rxBytes  txBytes
            severity       "ok" | "warn" | "error" | "off"
            stateText      short line, like "Connected"
            hintText       optional, shown when something's broken
            identityColor  a `color`; BarWidget assigns it, you just declare it

Functions   connectVpn()  disconnectVpn()  toggle()  refresh()
```

Drop `MyVpnProvider.qml` next to the others, declare it in `BarWidget.qml`
beside `PiaProvider`, add it to the `providers` list. That's the whole job.

### Or just have an AI write it

Honestly, great job to hand off. The contract is tiny and there are two working
examples sitting right there. Paste this at your assistant of choice:

> I'm writing a provider for the Omarchy `atomicangel.vpn` bar widget.
> Read `WireGuardProvider.qml` and `PiaProvider.qml` in this repo first, they
> define the interface I need to implement.
>
> Write `<Name>Provider.qml` for **<your VPN>**. It connects with
> `<connect command>`, disconnects with `<disconnect command>`, and I can check
> status using `<status command>`, which prints `<paste the real output>`.
>
> Rules:
> - Root is `Item { visible: false }`, imports `QtQuick` and `Quickshell.Io`.
> - Get all state in ONE `Process` per `refresh()`, using
>   `stdout: StdioCollector { waitForEnd: true; onStreamFinished: ... }`.
> - Do NOT use `FileView` on `/sys/class/net/...`. Those paths vanish when the
>   tunnel drops and the watcher never recovers.
> - Expose exactly: enabled, label, connected, busy, rxBytes, txBytes,
>   severity, stateText, hintText, identityColor, and
>   connectVpn/disconnectVpn/toggle/refresh. `identityColor` is a plain
>   `property color` the widget writes into; just declare it.
> - `severity` must be "error" when the VPN claims it's up but nothing is
>   coming through. Never trust systemd's "active" as proof of a live tunnel.
>
> Then show me the `shell.json` entry to add.

That last rule is the entire reason this widget exists, so don't let it skip it.

Check whatever it hands you before trusting it:

```bash
omarchy plugin validate .
qmllint -I "$OMARCHY_PATH/shell" <Name>Provider.qml
omarchy-shell shell rescanPlugins
qs log -p "$OMARCHY_PATH/shell" --tail 100   # QML only complains at load time
```

**Got one working? Send a PR.** I'd love to ship more providers, and I only own
the two VPNs I actually pay for.

## Privacy

Address and traffic rows stay hidden while a tunnel is down. There's no reason
to paint your address on your screen, where it lands in the first screenshot
you post.

Connection state alone isn't a safe gate for that, though. Some clients keep
reporting the underlying connection's address well after they say they're
connected — `piactl get pubip` is one of them. So the rule here is stricter:
any address seen while **not** connected is remembered, and is never shown as
an exit IP afterwards. A client that honestly reports its exit gets a row; one
that's still reporting the address the tunnel is meant to hide gets no row at
all. Erring toward the blank row costs nothing.

The plugin makes no network calls of its own. It shells out to `systemctl`,
`wg`, `piactl` and `ping`, and reads local files. That's the entire attack
surface.
